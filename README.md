## Running the app

Before running the app:
* Get an API key from [ai.google.dev](ai.google.dev).
* Create a Firebase project, and install the Flutter Firebase CLI, and configure the platforms that you want to run this app on. You can find instructions by following [steps 2-4 of the Get to know Firebase for Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter?hl=en#2) codelab.

Then, change all references to "API_KEY" to your API key.
